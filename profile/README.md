Product, security, and business development providing insightful interdisciplinary guidance through diversity and inclusivity, from the tech stack to design, communication, and geopolitical hedging.


## 💻 ⚙️ software studio specialized in Blockchain, Machine Learning, and UX

Full-stack platform development, creation of interactive environments that integrate social, digital, and physical systems…

We design, build and maintain a range of projects, from proof of concept and the minimum viable product to scaling. Channeling our energy on the grassroots Web3 movement that doesn’t foresee the manufactured consent of centralized trickle-down policies as an existential panacea.


## background 🧑‍💻👩‍💻

Solidity, Javascript, Python, Java, TensorFlow, NoSQL, Node.js, Django.py, React, Vue, IPFS, and containers. 


## 🔭 our vision

Software flourishes at the intersection of design and technology. Holistic, agnostic, and accessible jobs packed with new engaging UI paradigms for (d)apps, DAOs, crypto, investments, AI, web, chats, games, social, media, bots, fintech, adtech, healthtech, among others.

By solving a real problem and being laser focused on a valuable and measurable outcome, the service exempts itself from the need for growth hacking because it naturally thrives, being propelled by self-reinforcing network effects.

## ⏩ next chapter
The real potential of the web as an information tool is been underachieved.
Innovation and the mass adoption of disruptive technology reside in our hands to create and consume at will. 
We are, for better or for worse, always on. 
And this is both part of the problem and part of the solution for how we evolve as individuals and as an information society in the age of integral syncretism.
